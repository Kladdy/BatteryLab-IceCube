### Charging ###
RUN_ID 1:
    Date: ?
    CC max current: 2 A
    CV max voltage: 9*1.50 = 13.5 V
    Measuring time: 20 h
    Measuring interval: 2 min
    Temperature: 20 C

RUN_ID 3:
    Date: ?
    CC max current: 2 A
    CV max voltage: 9*1.50 = 13.5 V
    Measuring time: 2 days
    Measuring interval: 2 min
    Temperature: 20 C

RUN_ID 4:
    Date: 14/5-2022
    CC max current: 2 A
    CV max voltage: 9*1.50 = 13.5 V
    Measuring time: 3 days
    Measuring interval: 2 min
    Temperature: -50 C

RUN_ID 5: 
    Date: 16/5-2022 (after Discharging RUN_ID 4)
    CC max current: 2 A
    CV max voltage: 1.14*9*1.50 = 15.39 V
    Measuring time: 3 days
    Measuring interval: 2 min
    Temperature: -50 C
    Notes: Temperature adjustment of voltage. The previous charge did almost nothing.

RUN_ID 6: 
    Date: 17/5-2022 (after Discharging RUN_ID 5)
    CC max current: 2 A
    CV max voltage: 1.14*9*1.60 = 16.416 V
    Measuring time: 3 days
    Measuring interval: 2 min
    Temperature: -50 C
    Notes: Temperature adjustment of voltage + higher voltage


### Discharging ###
RUN_ID 2 (+ 2.1):
    Date: ?
    CW max power: 6
    Measuring time: 3 days
    Measuring interval: 2 min
    Temperature: 20 C

RUN_ID 3:
    Date: 11/5-2022
    CW max power: 12
    Measuring time: 3 days
    Measuring interval: 2 min
    Temperature: 20 C

RUN_ID 4:
    Date: 16/5-2022
    CW max power: 24
    Measuring time: 5 days
    Measuring interval: 2 min
    Temperature: -50 C
    Notes: The battery was barely charged, and lasted only for a few seconds. It seemed like
            the charging at low temperatues requires a voltage adjustment. See Charging RUN_ID 5.

RUN_ID 5:
    Date: 17/5-2022
    CW max power: 24
    Measuring time: 5 days
    Measuring interval: 2 min
    Temperature: -50 C
    Notes: The battery was barely charged, and lasted only for a few minutes,
        almost like for Discharging RUN_ID 4 but a little bit better due to the
        voltage temperatue adjustment

RUN_ID 6:
    Date: 23/5-2022
    CW max power: 24
    Measuring time: 5 days
    Measuring interval: 2 min
    Temperature: -50 C
